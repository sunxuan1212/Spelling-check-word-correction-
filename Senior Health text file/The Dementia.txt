Introduction.
A diagnosis of dementia can be
frightening for those affected by the
syndrome, their family members,
and caretakers Unfortunately, there
is a stigma associated with this term
Learning more about this medical
condition can help This booklet provides
a general overview of various types of
dementia, describes how the disorders
are diagnosed and treated, and offers
highlights of research supported by the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA),
both part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have a high impact on public
health and are a priority for NIH-supported research

The Basics of Dementia and Cognitive
Impairment.
Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning—the ability to think,
remember, or reason—to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s
daily life and activities These functions include memory, language skills,
visual perception, problem solving, self-management, and the ability to
focus and pay attention Some people with dementia cannot control their
emotions, and their personalities may change Dementia ranges in severity
from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s
functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend
completely on others for basic activities of daily living
Age is the primary risk factor for developing dementia For that reason, the
number of people living with dementia could double in the next 40 years as
the number of Americans age 65 and older increases from 48 million today
to more than 88 million in 2050 Regardless of the form of dementia, the
personal, economic, and societal demands can be devastating
Dementia is not the same as age-related cognitive decline—when certain
areas of thinking, memory, and information processing slow with age, but
intelligence remains unchanged Unlike dementia, age-related memory
loss isn’t disabling Occasional lapses of forgetfulness are normal in elderly
adults While dementia is more common with advanced age (as many as
half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is
not an inevitable part of aging Many people live into their 90s and beyond
without any signs of dementia
Dementia is also not the same as delirium, which is usually a shortterm complication of a medical condition and most often can be treated
successfully Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy
neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with 

other brain cells, and die While everyone loses some neurons as they age,
people with dementia experience far greater loss
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage between normal cognitive
changes that may occur with age and more serious symptoms that indicate
dementia Symptoms of MCI can include problems with thinking,
judgment, memory, and language, but the loss doesn’t significantly interfere
with the ability to handle everyday activities Symptoms of MCI include
mild memory loss; difficulty with planning or organization; trouble finding
words; frequently losing or misplacing things; and forgetting names,
conversations, and events Someone who has MCI may be at greater risk of
eventually developing Alzheimer’s or another type of dementia, particularly
if the degree of memory impairment is significant, but MCI does not
always progress to dementia Symptoms may remain stable for several
years, and even improve over time in some people
It is common to have more than one cause of dementia Many people with
dementia have both Alzheimer’s disease and one or more closely related
disorders that share brain scanning or clinical features (and sometimes both)
with Alzheimer’s disease When a person is affected by more than one
dementia disorder, the dementia can be referred to as a mixed dementia
Autopsy studies of the brains of people who had dementia suggest that a
majority of those age 80 and older probably had mixed dementia caused by
Alzheimer’s-related neurodegenerative processes, vascular disease-related
processes, or another neurodegenerative condition In fact, some studies
indicate that mixed vascular-degenerative dementia is the most common
cause of dementia in the elderly
Researchers are still trying to understand the underlying disease processes
involved in dementia Scientists have some theories about mechanisms that
may lead to different forms of dementia, but more research is needed to
better understand if and how these mechanisms are involved

Dementias Associated with Aging and
Neurodegeneration.
Various disorders and factors contribute to dementia, resulting in a
progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functions Currently,
there are no cures for these neurodegenerative disorders
Some specific causes of dementia disorders are explained below
Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults
As many as 5 million Americans age 65 and older may have the disease
In most neurodegenerative diseases, certain proteins abnormally clump
together and are thought to damage healthy neurons, causing them to stop
functioning and die In Alzheimer’s, fragments of a protein called amyloid
form abnormal clusters called plaques between brain cells, and a protein
called tau forms tangles inside nerve cells
It seems likely that damage to the brain
starts a decade or more before memory
and other cognitive problems appear
The damage often initially appears
in the hippocampus, the part of the
brain essential in forming memories
Ultimately, the abnormal plaques and
tangles spread throughout the brain, and
brain tissue significantly shrinks
As Alzheimer’s disease progresses, people experience greater memory loss
and other cognitive difficulties Problems can include wandering and getting
lost, trouble handling money and paying bills, repeating questions, taking
longer to complete normal daily tasks, and personality and behavior changes.

People are often diagnosed in this stage Memory loss and confusion worsen,
and people begin to have problems recognizing family and friends They
may be unable to learn new things, carry out multi-step tasks such as getting
dressed, or cope with new situations In addition, people at this stage may
have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia and may behave impulsively
People with severe Alzheimer’s cannot communicate and are completely
dependent on others for their care Near the end, the person may be in bed
most or all of the time as body functions shut down Certain drugs can
temporarily slow some symptoms of Alzheimer’s from getting worse, but
currently there are no treatments that stop the progression of the disease For
more information on Alzheimer’s disease, visit the Alzheimer’s and related
Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center at wwwalzheimersgov
Researchers have not found a single gene solely responsible for Alzheimer’s
disease; rather, multiple genes are likely involved One genetic risk factor—
having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome
19—does increase a person’s risk for developing Alzheimer’s People who
inherit one copy of this APOE ε4 allele have an increased chance of
developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even
greater risk (An allele is a variant form of a pair of genes that are located
on a particular chromosome and control the same trait) The APOE ε4
allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other
symptoms Researchers have found that this allele is associated with an
increased number of amyloid plaques in the brain tissue of affected people
Frontotemporal Disorders.
Frontotemporal disorders are forms of dementia caused by a family of
neurodegenerative brain diseases collectively called frontotemporal lobar
degeneration They primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the
brain, rather than the widespread shrinking and wasting away (atrophy) of
brain tissue seen in Alzheimer’s disease In these disorders, changes to nerve.

cells in the brain’s frontal lobes affect
the ability to reason and make decisions,
prioritize and multitask, act appropriately,
and control movement Changes to the
temporal lobes affect memory and how
people understand words, recognize
objects, and recognize and respond to
emotions Some people decline rapidly
over 2 to 3 years, while others show only minimal changes for many years
People can live with frontotemporal disorders for 2 to 10 years, sometimes
longer, but it is difficult to predict the time course for an affected individual
The signs and symptoms may vary greatly among individuals as different parts
of the brain are affected No treatment that can cure or reverse frontotemporal
disorders is currently available
Clinically, frontotemporal disorders are classified into two main types
of syndromes:
* Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) involves
changes in behavior, judgment, and personality People with this disorder
may have problems with cognition, but their memory may stay relatively
intact They may do impulsive things that are out of character or may
engage in repetitive, unusual behaviors People with bvFTD also may
say or do inappropriate things or become uncaring Over time, language
and/or movement problems may occur.
* Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) involves changes in the ability
to speak, understand, and express thoughts and/or words and to write
and read Many people with PPA, though not all, develop symptoms
of dementia Problems with memory, reasoning, and judgment are not
apparent at first but can develop and progress over time Sometimes
a person with PPA cannot recognize the faces of familiar people
and common objects (called semantic PPA) Other individuals have.


increasing trouble producing speech and may eventually be unable to
speak at all (called agrammatic PPA) PPA is a language disorder that
is not the same as the problems with speech and ability to read and
write (called aphasia) that can result from a stroke
Other types of frontotemporal disorders include:
* Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) involves progressive nerve-cell loss
and atrophy of specific areas of the brain, which can affect memory,
behavior, thinking, language, and movement The disease is named
after parts of the brain that are affected—the cerebral cortex (the outer
part of the brain) and the basal ganglia (structures deep in the brain
involved with movement) Not everyone who has CBD has problems
with memory, cognition, language, or behavior The disease tends to
progress gradually, with early symptoms beginning around age 60
Some of the movement symptoms of CBD are similar to those seen in
Parkinson’s disease.
* Frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease (FTD/MND,
also called FTD-ALS) is a combination of behavioral variant
frontotemporal dementia and the progressive neuromuscular weakness
typically seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ALS is a
neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells responsible for
controlling voluntary muscles (muscle action that can be controlled,
such as that in the arms, legs, and face) Symptoms of either disease
may appear first, with other symptoms developing over time
* Pick’s disease is characterized by Pick bodies—masses comprised
of the protein tau that accumulate inside nerve cells, causing them
to appear enlarged or balloon-like It is usually seen with bvFTD
but sometimes with PPA Some symptoms are similar to those of
Alzheimer’s disease, including loss of speech, changes in behavior,
and trouble with thinking However, while inappropriate behavior
characterizes the early stages of Pick’s disease, memory loss is often 
8
the first symptom of Alzheimer’s Antidepressants and antipsychotics
can control some of the behavioral symptoms of Pick’s disease, but no
treatment is available to stop the disease from progressing
* Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a brain disease that can
cause problems with thinking, memory, behavior, problem solving, and
judgment It also affects the control of eye movements, mood, speech,
swallowing, vision, concentration, and language Because certain parts
of the brain that control movement are damaged, this disease shares
some of the problems with movement seen in people with corticobasal
degeneration and Parkinson’s disease
Lewy Body Dementia
Lewy body dementia (LBD) is one of the most common causes of
dementia after Alzheimer’s disease and vascular disease It typically begins
after age 50, but can occur earlier It involves abnormal protein deposits
called Lewy bodies, which are balloon-like structures that form inside
nerve cells The abnormal buildup of the protein alpha-synuclein and other
proteins causes neurons to work less effectively and die Initial symptoms
may vary, but over time, people with these disorders develop similar
cognitive, behavioral, physical, and sleep-related symptoms
Lewy body dementia includes two related conditions—dementia with Lewy
bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia In dementia with Lewy bodies, the
cognitive symptoms are seen within a year of movement symptoms called
parkinsonism (including tremor, difficulty with walking and posture, and
rigid muscles) In Parkinson’s disease dementia, the cognitive symptoms
develop more than a year after movement problems begin
* Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the more common forms
of progressive dementia Neurons in the outer layer of the brain (cortex)
and in the substantia nigra (a region involved with the production of
dopamine) degenerate Many neurons that remain contain Lewy bodies 

Symptoms such as difficulty sleeping,
loss of smell, and visual hallucinations
often precede movement and other
problems by as many as 10 years Later
in the course of DLB, some signs and
symptoms are similar to Alzheimer’s
disease and may include memory loss,
poor judgment, and confusion Other
signs and symptoms of DLB are similar to those of Parkinson’s disease,
including difficulty with movement and posture, a shuffling walk, and
changes in alertness and attention There is no cure for DLB, but there
are drugs that control some symptoms
* Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) can occur in people with Parkinson’s
disease, but not all people with Parkinson’s disease will develop dementia
PDD may affect memory, social judgment, language, or reasoning
Autopsy studies show that people with PDD often have Lewy bodies in
the cortex and other brain areas, and many have amyloid plaques and tau
tangles like those found in people with Alzheimer’s disease, though it is
not understood what these similarities mean The time from the onset of
movement symptoms to the onset of dementia symptoms varies greatly
from person to person Risk factors for developing PDD include the onset
of Parkinson’s-related movement symptoms followed by mild cognitive
impairment and REM sleep behavior disorder, which involves having
frequent nightmares and hallucinations
Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment
and Dementia
Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID)
cause significant changes to memory, thinking, and behavior Cognition and
brain function can be significantly affected by the size, location, and number
of brain injuries Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment arise 
10
as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular
disease (stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, and
high cholesterol Symptoms of VCID can begin suddenly and progress
or subside during one’s lifetime VCID can occur along with Alzheimer’s
disease Persons with VCID almost always have abnormalities in the
brain on magnetic resonance imaging scans These include evidence of
prior strokes, often small and asymptomatic, as well as diffuse changes in
the brain’s “white matter”—the connecting “wires” of the brain that are
critical for relaying messages between brain regions Microscopic brain
examination shows thickening of blood vessel walls called arteriosclerosis
and thinning or loss of components of the white matter
Forms of VCID include:
* Vascular dementia refers to progressive loss of memory and other
cognitive functions caused by vascular injury or disease within the
brain Symptoms of vascular dementia may sometimes be difficult to
distinguish from Alzheimer’s disease Problems with organization,
attention, slowed thinking, and problem solving are all more prominent
in VCID, while memory loss is more prominent in Alzheimer’s
* Vascular cognitive impairment involves changes with language, attention,
and the ability to think, reason, and remember that are noticeable but are
not significant enough to greatly impact daily life These changes, caused
by vascular injury or disease within the brain, progress slowly over time
* Post-stroke dementia can develop months after a major stroke Not
everyone who has had a major stroke will develop vascular dementia, but the
risk for dementia is significantly higher in someone who has had a stroke
* Multi-infarct dementia is the result of many small strokes (infarcts) and
mini-strokes Language or other functions may be impaired, depending
on the region of the brain that is affected. The risk for dementia is significantly higher in someone who
has had a stroke Dementia is more
likely when strokes affect both sides
of the brain Even strokes that don’t
show any noticeable symptoms can
increase the risk of dementia
* Cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
(CADASIL) is an extremely rare inherited disorder caused by a
thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels,
which reduces the flow of blood to the brain CADASIL is associated
with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, and other disorders The first
symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40 CADASIL
may have symptoms that can be confused with multiple sclerosis
Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed
* Subcortical vascular dementia, previously called Binswanger’s disease,
involves extensive microscopic damage to the small blood vessels and
nerve fibers that make up white matter Some consider it an aggressive
form of multi-infarct dementia Cognitive changes include problems
with short-term memory, organization, attention, decision making, and
behavior Symptoms tend to begin after age 60, and they progress in a
stepwise manner People with subcortical vascular disease often have
high blood pressure, a history of stroke, or evidence of disease of the
large blood vessels in the neck or heart valves
* Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a buildup of amyloid plaques in the walls
of blood vessels in the brain It is generally diagnosed when multiple tiny
bleeds in the brain are discovered using magnetic resonance imaging 
12
Neuropathology of Neurodegenerative
Disorders
The different forms of age-related dementia, as well as many age-related
neurodegenerative diseases, are thought to be caused by changes in various
proteins These diseases are called proteinopathies because they involve the
abnormal buildup of specific proteins in the brain Mutations in genes that
provide instructions for making these proteins have been found to cause
dementia in families However, in the vast majority of affected individuals,
dementia is not inherited, and the cause is unknown Alzheimer’s disease,
frontotemporal disorders, and Lewy body dementia are proteinopathies
In some dementias, changes in the protein tau cause it to form clumps
inside nerve cells in the brain, which is believed to make the cells stop
functioning properly and die Disorders that are associated with the
abnormal buildup of tau are called tauopathies
In Alzheimer’s disease, the tau protein aggregates (accumulates into
abnormal clumps) and becomes twisted and tangled, forming fibers—
called neurofibrillary or tau tangles—inside neurons Abnormal clumps
(plaques) of another protein, called beta-amyloid, are prominent in spaces
between brain cells Both plaques and tangles are thought to contribute to
reduced function and nerve-cell death in Alzheimer’s and are the hallmarks
of the disease
Beta-amyloid plaques are also seen in some forms of LBD, cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, and Parkinson’s disease dementia They are also
common in elderly individuals who do not have dementia
13
Some, but not all, forms of frontotemporal disorders are tauopathies
Other forms of these disorders are associated with the buildup of the
protein TDP-43 A mutation in a gene called progranulin, and another
in a gene called C9orf72, can cause frontotemporal disorders with
accumulation of TDP-43 in nerve cells
In other dementias and some brain disorders, the protein synuclein becomes
misshapen and forms harmful clumps inside neurons in different brain
regions Disorders in which synuclein builds up inside neurons are called
synucleinopathies Changes in synuclein and/or its function are the basis
of LBD and other disorders such as multiple system atrophy Multiple
system atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized
by a combination of symptoms that affect both the autonomic nervous
system (the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary action
such as blood pressure or digestion) and movement These changes cause
parkinsonism, a condition resembling Parkinson’s disease
14
Reversible Dementia-like Disorders and
Conditions
Many conditions that cause dementia-like symptoms can be halted or even
reversed with the appropriate treatment
* Normal pressure hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of
cerebrospinal fluid in the brain Elderly individuals with the condition
usually have trouble with walking and bladder control before the onset
of dementia Normal pressure hydrocephalus can be treated or even
reversed by implanting a shunt system to divert fluid from the brain
* Nutritional deficiencies of vitamin B1 (thiamine), caused by chronic
alcoholism, and of vitamin B12 can be reversed with treatment
People who have abused substances such as alcohol and recreational
drugs sometimes display signs of dementia even after the substance
abuse has stopped
* Side effects of medications or drug combinations may cause cognitive
impairment that looks like a degenerative or vascular dementia but that
could reverse upon stopping these medications
* Vasculitis, an inflammation of brain blood vessels, can cause dementia
after multiple strokes and may be treated with immunosuppressive
medications
* Subdural hematoma, or bleeding between the brain’s surface and its
outer covering (the dura), is common after a fall Subdural hematomas
can cause dementia-like symptoms and changes in mental function
With treatment, some symptoms can be reversed
* Some non-malignant brain tumors can cause symptoms resembling
dementia Recovery occurs following their removal by neurosurgery
* Some chronic infections around the brain, so-called chronic
meningitis, can cause dementia and may be treatable by drugs that kill
the infectious agent
15
Other Neurodegenerative Diseases and
Conditions with Dementia or Dementialike Symptoms
Doctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or
dementia-like symptoms The diseases have different symptoms that involve
body and brain functions, and they affect mental health and cognition
* Argyrophilic grain disease is a common, late-onset degenerative
disease that affects brain regions involved in memory and emotion
It causes cognitive decline and changes in memory and behavior,
with difficulty finding words The disease’s signs and symptoms are
indistinguishable from late-onset Alzheimer’s disease Confirmation of
the diagnosis can be made only at autopsy
* Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare brain disorder that is characterized
by rapidly progressing dementia Infectious proteins called prions
become misfolded and tend to clump together, causing the brain
damage Initial symptoms include impaired memory, judgment, and
thinking, along with loss of muscle coordination and impaired vision
Some symptoms of this brain disorder are similar to symptoms of
other progressive neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
* Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repeated
traumatic brain injury (TBI) in some people who suffered multiple
concussions People with CTE may
develop dementia, poor coordination,
slurred speech, and other symptoms
similar to those seen in Parkinson’s
disease 20 years or more after the
injury Late-stage CTE is also
characterized by brain atrophy and
widespread deposits of tau in nerve 
16
cells In some people, even just 5 to 10 years beyond the TBI, behavioral
and mood changes may occur Dementia may not yet be present and the
brain may not have started to shrink, but small deposits of tau are seen in
specific brain regions at autopsy
* Huntington’s disease is an inherited, progressive brain disease that
affects a person’s judgment, memory, ability to plan and organize, and
other cognitive functions Symptoms typically begin around age 30 or
40 and include abnormal and uncontrollable movements called chorea,
as well as problems with walking and lack of coordination Cognitive
problems worsen as the disease progresses, and problems controlling
movement lead to complete loss of ability for self-care
* HIV-associated dementia (HAD) can occur in people who have
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS
HAD damages the brain’s white matter and leads to a type of dementia
associated with memory problems, social withdrawal, and trouble
concentrating People with HAD may develop movement problems
as well The incidence of HAD has dropped dramatically with the
availability of effective antiretroviral therapies for managing the
underlying virus
* Secondary dementias occur in people with disorders that damage
brain tissue Such disorders may include multiple sclerosis, meningitis,
and encephalitis, as well as Wilson’s disease (in which excessive
amounts of copper build up to cause brain damage) People with
malignant brain tumors may develop dementia or dementia-like
symptoms because of damage to their brain circuits or a buildup of
pressure inside the skull
17
Risk Factors for Dementia and Cognitive
Impairment
The following risk factors may increase a person’s chance of developing
one or more kinds of dementia Some of these factors can be modified,
while others cannot
* Age Advancing age is the best-known risk factor for developing dementia
* Hypertension High blood pressure has been linked to cognitive
decline, stroke, and types of dementia that damage the white matter
regions of the brain High blood pressure causes “wear and tear” to
brain blood vessel walls called arteriosclerosis
* Stroke A single major stroke or a series of smaller strokes increases a
person’s risk of developing vascular dementia A person who has had a
stroke is at an increased risk of having additional strokes, which further
increases the risk of developing dementia
* Alcohol use Most studies suggest that
regularly drinking large amounts of
alcohol increases the risk of dementia
Specific dementias, such as WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, are associated with
alcohol abuse
* Atherosclerosis The accumulation of fats and cholesterol in the
lining of arteries, coupled with an inflammatory process that leads to
a thickening of the blood vessel walls (known as atherosclerosis), can
lead to stroke, which raises the risk for vascular dementia
* Diabetes Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for stroke and
cardiovascular disease, which in turn increase the risk for vascular
dementia
* Down syndrome Many people with Down syndrome develop
symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease by the time they reach middle age
18
* Genetics The chance of developing a genetically linked form of
dementia increases when more than one family member has the disorder
In many dementias, there can be a family history of a similar disease In
some cases, such as with frontotemporal disorders, having just one parent
who carries a mutation increases the risk of inheriting the condition A
very small proportion of dementia is inherited
* Head injury An impact to the head can cause a TBI Certain
types of TBI or repeated TBIs can cause dementia and other severe
cognitive problems
* Parkinson’s disease The degeneration and death of nerve cells in
the brain of people with Parkinson’s disease can cause dementia and
significant memory loss
* Smoking Smoking increases the risk of developing cardiovascular
diseases that slow or stop blood from getting to the brain
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine recently released a report of the evidence on
preventing dementia:

19
Diagnosis
To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether an individual has an
underlying treatable condition such as abnormal thyroid function, vitamin
deficiency, or normal pressure hydrocephalus that may relate to cognitive
difficulties Early detection of symptoms is important, as some causes
can be treated In many cases, the specific type of dementia may not be
confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined
An assessment generally includes:
* Medical history and physical exam
Assessing a person’s medical and
family history, current symptoms and
medication, and vital signs can help
the doctor detect conditions that
might cause or occur with dementia
Some conditions may be treatable
* Neurological evaluations Assessing balance, sensory response,
reflexes, and other functions helps the doctor identify signs of
conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs
Doctors also might use an electroencephalogram to check for abnormal
electrical brain activity
* Brain scans Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging
can detect structural abnormalities and rule out other causes of
dementia Positron emission tomography can look for patterns of
altered brain activity that are common in dementia Recent advances
in positron emission tomography can detect amyloid plaques and tau
tangles in Alzheimer’s disease
* Cognitive and neuropsychological tests These tests are used to
assess memory, language skills, math skills, problem solving, and other
abilities related to mental functioning
20
* Laboratory tests Testing a person’s blood and other fluids, as well as
checking levels of various chemicals, hormones, and vitamin levels, can
identify or rule out conditions that may contribute to dementia
* Presymptomatic tests Genetic testing can help some people who have
a strong family history of dementia identify risk for a dementia with a
known gene defect
* Psychiatric evaluation This evaluation will help determine
if depression or another mental health condition is causing or
contributing to a person’s symptoms
Guidelines prepared by NIA and the Alzheimer’s Association focus on three
stages of Alzheimer’s disease: dementia due to Alzheimer’s, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s, and preclinical (presymptomatic)
Alzheimer’s (Presymptomatic identification is exclusively used as a research
diagnosis at this point and is not relevant to routine clinical practice) The
guidelines also include biomarker tests used in research studies to measure
biological changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease and
criteria for documenting and reporting Alzheimer’s-related changes observed
during an autopsy
21
Treatment and Management
There are currently no treatments to stop or slow dementia caused by
neurodegenerative diseases Some diseases that occur at the same time
as dementia, such as diabetes and depression, can be treated Other
symptoms that may occur in dementia-like conditions can also be treated,
although some symptoms may only respond to treatment for a period of
time A team of specialists—doctors, nurses, and speech, physical, and
other therapists—familiar with these disorders can help guide patient care
Medications are available to treat
certain behavioral symptoms, delusions,
depression, muscle stiffness, and
risk factors for vascular cognitive
impairment such as high blood pressure
Always consult with a doctor as some
medications may make symptoms worse
Neurodegenerative diseases can be
treated and managed as follows:
* Alzheimer’s disease Most drugs are used to treat symptoms in
Alzheimer’s One class of drugs, called cholinesterase inhibitors, can
temporarily improve or stabilize memory and thinking skills in some
people by increasing activity of the cholinergic brain network—a
subsystem in the brain that is highly involved with memory
and learning These drugs include donepezil, rivastigmine, and
galantamine The drug memantine is in another class of medications
called NMDA receptor antagonists, which prevent declines in learning
and memory Memantine may be combined with a cholinesterase
inhibitor for added benefits These drugs are sometimes used to treat
other dementias in which Alzheimer’s disease is believed to co-occur 
22
* Frontotemporal disorders There are no medications approved to
treat or prevent these disorders and most other types of progressive
dementia Sedatives, antidepressants, and other drugs used to treat
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s symptoms may help manage certain
symptoms and behavioral problems associated with the disorders
* Dementia with Lewy bodies Medicines for managing DLB are aimed
at relieving symptoms such as gait and balance disturbances, stiffness,
hallucinations, and delusions Studies suggest that cholinesterase
inhibitor drugs used to treat people with Alzheimer’s disease may offer
some benefit to people with DLB
* Parkinson’s disease dementia Some studies suggest that the
cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat people with Alzheimer’s might
improve cognitive, behavioral, and psychotic symptoms in people with
PDD Unfortunately, many of the medications used to treat the motor
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease worsen the cognitive problems The
US Food and Drug Administration has approved rivastigmine, an
Alzheimer’s drug, to treat cognitive symptoms in PDD
* Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia This
type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes or
reduce the risk of additional brain damage Some studies suggest that
drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer’s might benefit people with
early vascular dementia Treating the modifiable risk factors can help
prevent additional stroke
A team of therapists can help with maintaining physical movement,
addressing speech and swallowing issues, and learning new ways to handle
loss of skills with everyday tasks such as feeding oneself
23
It is important to educate family, friends, and caregivers about a loved one’s
medical issues Also, in-person and online support groups offered by many
disease awareness and caregiver advocacy organizations can give families and
other caregivers additional resources, as well as opportunities to share experiences
and express concerns (See the Resources section at the end of this booklet)

Research
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a
component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the leading federal
funder of research on nervous system disorders, including dementia Another
NIH Institute, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), is the leading federal
funder of research on Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias Together, these
Institutes are world leaders in supporting
research on the dementias, including
Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal
disorders, and vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment and dementia
Although scientists have some understanding of the dementias and
the mechanisms involved, ongoing research may lead to new ways to
understand the causes of these diseases and to diagnose, treat, or perhaps
prevent or block disease development
Research partnerships on dementia involving NIA and NINDS include:
The National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) authorized a coordinated
national plan to attack Alzheimer’s disease and improve care and services
NAPA calls for increased collaboration between scientists, the federal
government, and public organizations while improving patient care The
resulting National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease is designed to
expand research on Alzheimer’s and related dementias prevention and
treatment and to move the most promising drugs from discovery into
clinical trials The National Plan also calls for increased federal funding for
Alzheimer’s research, as well as support for those affected by the disease
and their families, increased public awareness about Alzheimer’s, and
improved data collection and analysis These goals also apply to Lewy body,
frontotemporal, mixed, and vascular dementias The Plan’s overarching 
25
research goal is to “prevent or effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 2025”
For more information, see http://aspehhsgov/national-alzheimers-project-act
Accelerating Medicine Partnership–Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD)
is a multi-sector partnership among NIH, 10 biopharmaceutical
companies, and several nonprofit organizations to develop new, clinically
relevant therapeutics and biomarkers to confirm existing therapies The
goal is to speed up the process of bringing new medicines to people
either with or at risk of Alzheimer’s disease For more information, see
wwwnianihgov/research/amp-ad
M2OVE-AD (Molecular Mechanisms of the Vascular Etiology of
Alzheimer’s Disease) allows scientists from diverse fields to work
collaboratively to understand the complex molecular mechanisms by which
vascular risk factors influence Alzheimer’s The work also will identify new
targets for treatment and prevention M2OVE-AD builds on the openscience approach and the big-data infrastructure established by AMD-AP
For more information, see wwwnihgov/file/27681
The Tau Center Without Walls program is designed to increase
collaboration and sharing of data and resources among researchers to
better understand the protein tau and its involvement in disorders such
as frontotemporal degeneration These efforts may lead to advances
in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of tau toxicity associated with
frontotemporal disorders and contribute to tool development that can be
applied in clinical trials for frontotemporal and other tau-related disorders
The Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium is designed to expand
the collection of clinical data and biological specimens in the NINDS
Parkinson’s Disease Biomarkers Program to include data from people
with Lewy body dementias Standardized research and data collection and
reporting systems will make it easier for researchers to share and confirm
their research For more information, see https://pdbpnindsnihgov/

Researchers in the Small Vessel Vascular Contributions to Cognitive
Impairment and Dementia (VCID) Biomarkers Program hope
to develop biomarkers of key vascular processes related to VCID in
Alzheimer’s disease Identifying biomarkers may improve the efficiency
and outcome of trials designed to test drug effectiveness and safety in
humans and speed the development of therapies for the dementias
Additional NIA/NINDS research on age-related and other dementias
includes:
Clinical studies Clinical studies offer an opportunity to help researchers
find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent the dementias Various NIH
Institutes support clinical studies on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
at the NIH research campus in Bethesda, MD, and at medical research centers
throughout the United States For information about participating in clinical
studies for Alzheimer’s, related dementias, and other disorders, visit “NIH
Clinical Research Trials and You” at wwwnihgov/health/clinicaltrials For a
list of Alzheimer’s and related dementias clinical trials and studies, see
wwwnianihgov/alzheimers/clinical-trials For a comprehensive list of all trials,
go to wwwclinicaltrialsgov and type in the name of the dementia, such as
“Lewy body dementia” or “vascular dementia”
Biomarkers Several research projects hope to identify dementia biomarkers
(measurable biological signs that may indicate disease risk and progression or
confirm diagnosis) Such biomarkers could be detected through brain imaging
or even blood tests Research projects include the study of possible biomarkers
to predict cognitive decline in people with Parkinson’s disease, the Alzheimer’s
Biomarkers Consortium of Down Syndrome (many people with Down syndrome
have Alzheimer’s-related brain changes in their 30s that can lead to dementia in
their 50s and 60s), and genetic and biomarker studies that may lead to promising
treatments for frontotemporal disorders The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal study to validate the use of biomarkers for
Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials and diagnosis (see wwwadni-infoorg)
27
Drugs and compounds A number of drugs and compounds that might
slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are in
various stages of testing A NINDS-NIA study found that tau antisense
oligonucleotides—compounds that are genetically engineered to block
a cell’s assembly line production of the toxic form of the protein tau—
could prevent and reverse some brain injury caused by tau in animal
models NIH-supported prevention trials are testing promising drugs
that target amyloid proteins that form plaques in the brain Other NIH
studies include the use of drugs being developed to treat autism spectrum
disorders to see if they can improve cognitive function in people with agerelated cognitive decline
Exercise Physical activity can benefit
mental well-being and improve daily
functioning and quality of life in people
with dementia Researchers are assessing
the combined approach of aerobic and
cognitive exercise to see if it can delay
or slow the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease in at-risk older adults Other
research is assessing the benefit of
exercise to delay MCI in older individuals and to improve brain function
in older adults who may be at risk for developing Alzheimer’s
Genetics NIH scientists continue to look for new genes that may be
responsible for the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of
dementia One approach is using genome-wide association studies, which
can rapidly scan the complete sets of DNA, or genomes, of many people
to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease Identifying
new genetic associations for neurodegenerative diseases may lead to better
strategies to detect, treat, and prevent the dementias
28
Imaging Clinical imaging may help
researchers better understand changes in
the brains of people with dementia, as
well as help diagnose these disorders For
example, research hopes to enhance brain
imaging techniques to make it possible to
detect and try to stop the earliest changes
in the protective blood-brain barrier
that may contribute to VCID ADNI
has identified and developed imaging techniques and biomarker measures
in blood and cerebrospinal fluid that are being used in research to track
changes in the living brains of older people who are cognitively normal,
have MCI, or have mild Alzheimer’s disease
International efforts The International Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Portfolio (IADRP) helps individuals learn about research related to both
Alzheimer’s and related dementias at public and private organizations
worldwide It also helps organizations leverage resources and avoid
duplication of effort The Common Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Ontology—a classification system that allows organizations to integrate
and compare research portfolios—was developed by NIA, NIH, and the
Alzheimer’s Association For more information, see http://iadrpnianihgov
Natural history studies Studying groups of people over time may lead
to ways to identify those at risk of developing dementia or cognitive
impairment Three NIH-funded research teams, for example, are conducting
longitudinal studies of individuals in which frontotemporal disorders
run in families or appear on their own to understand the progression of
frontotemporal disorders both before and after symptom onset; identify
genes; discover biomarkers for diagnosis, progression, and prognosis; and
establish a clinical research consortium to support therapy development
29
Proteins A number of proteins—including tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43,
and beta-amyloid—are involved with various cellular processes When
there is a change in the genes that direct the production or rate of clearance
of these proteins, the proteins can build into abnormal amounts and form
abnormal clumps that damage nerve cells in the brain, causing dementia,
movement, and other symptoms NIH-funded research projects seek to
better understand the toxic effects of protein buildup and how it is related
to the development of dementia For example, a number of studies target
the buildup of amyloid, which forms plaques that are characteristic in
Alzheimer’s disease Other researchers hope to better understand how
proteins misfold and become harmful in frontotemporal disorders and LBD
Stem cells Stem cells are unique in that they have the potential to develop
into many different cell types in the body, including brain cells Scientists are
exploring various types of cells, including stem cells, to discover nerve-cell
mechanisms that lead to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease
and other forms of dementia For example, scientists converted human
skin cells into a model of human neurons Such neurons, when created
from individuals with familial forms of Alzheimer’s, show biochemical
changes that are typical of the disease Researchers are also investigating
the mechanism by which human Alzheimer’s neurons develop cellular and
molecular defects in protein production and degradation
Additional NIH research projects More information about dementias
research supported by NIA, NINDS, and other NIH Institutes and
Centers can be found using NIH RePORTER, a searchable database of
current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal
agencies RePORTER also includes links to publications and resources

Conclusion
Currently, there are no cures for the common dementias caused by progressive
neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal disorders,
and Lewy body dementia Some evidence suggests that controlling vascular
risk factors, such as high blood pressure, may reduce the risk of developing
dementia decades later Some symptoms of dementia and conditions that
cause dementia or have dementia-like symptoms are treatable A better
understanding of dementia disorders, as well as their diagnosis and treatment,
will make it possible for affected individuals and their caretakers to live their
lives more fully and meet daily challenges NIH, primarily through research
activities funded by NIA and NINDS, continues to improve diagnosis, design
therapeutic approaches to dementias, and create tools and resources to help
speed the development of treatments that can be used in practice These
discoveries may eventually lead to ways to slow disease progression or even
cure and prevent the dementias

Glossary
Alpha-synuclein—the major protein present in abnormal clumps called
Lewy bodies, which are seen in the brains of people with Parkinson’s
disease and some dementias Disorders in which alpha-synuclein
accumulates inside nerve cells are called synucleinopathies
Alzheimer’s disease—the most common cause of dementia in older
adults Nearly all brain functions, including memory, movement, language,
judgment, and behavior, are eventually affected Alzheimer’s disease is
defined by high levels of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain
Amyloid—a protein that aggregates to form plaques that appear in the
brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease
Biomarkers—measurable biological signs in the living body that may
indicate risk or progression of a disease and improve diagnosis
Corticobasal degeneration—a progressive disorder characterized by
abnormal buildup of the protein tau, nerve-cell loss, and atrophy in
multiple areas of the brain
Dementia—a condition in which impaired thinking and memory
significantly interfere with daily life
Dementia with Lewy bodies—a type of Lewy body dementia
Frontotemporal disorders—a group of dementias characterized by
degeneration of nerve cells, especially those in the frontal and temporal
lobes of the brain
Lewy body dementia—a progressive dementia characterized by the
presence of abnormal structures called Lewy bodies in the brain
Mild cognitive impairment—a stage between normal cognitive changes that
may occur with age and the more serious symptoms that indicate dementia
32
Mixed dementia—dementia in which one form of dementia and another
condition or dementia cause damage to the brain; for example, Alzheimer’s
disease and small vessel disease or vascular dementia
