Taking Care of Your
Teeth and Mouth
Healthy teeth and gums make it easy
for you to eat well and enjoy good food.
Several problems can affect the health of
your mouth, but good care should keep
your teeth and gums strong as you age.
Tooth Decay
Teeth are covered in a hard, outer
coating called enamel. Every day, a thin
film of bacteria called dental plaque builds
up on your teeth. The bacteria in plaque
produce acids that can harm enamel and
cause cavities. Brushing and flossing
your teeth can prevent decay, but once a
cavity forms, a dentist has to fix it.
Use fluoride toothpaste to protect
your teeth from decay. If you are at a
higher risk for tooth decay (for example,
if you have a dry mouth because of a
condition you have or medicines you
take), you might need more fluoride.
Your dentist or dental hygienist may
give you a fluoride treatment during an
office visit or may tell you to use a
fluoride gel or mouth rinse at home.
Gum Disease
Gum disease begins when plaque
builds up along and under your gum line.
This plaque causes infections that hurt the
gum and bone that hold your teeth in
place. Gum disease may make your gums
tender and more likely to bleed. This
problem, called gingivitis, can often be
fixed by brushing and flossing every day.
A more severe form of gum disease,
called periodontitis, must be treated by a
dentist. If not treated, this infection can
ruin the bones, gums, and other tissues
that support your teeth. Over time, your
teeth may have to be removed.
To prevent gum disease:
■ Brush your teeth twice a day with
fluoride toothpaste.
■ Floss once a day.
■ Visit your dentist regularly for a
checkup and cleaning.
■ Eat a well-balanced diet.
■ Quit smoking. Smoking increases
your risk for gum disease.
How to Clean Your Teeth and
Gums
There is a right way to brush and
floss your teeth. Every day:
■ Gently brush your teeth on all sides
with a soft-bristle brush and fluoride
toothpaste. 
■ Use small circular motions and short
back-and-forth strokes.
■ Brush carefully and gently along your
gum line.
■ Lightly brush your tongue to help
keep your mouth clean.
■ Clean around your teeth with dental
floss. Careful flossing removes plaque and
leftover food that a toothbrush can’t reach.
■ Rinse after you floss.
How to Floss
Use foss

upper teeth.
Use foss
between
lower teeth.
Hold foss
as shown.
People with arthritis or other conditions
that limit hand motion may find it hard to
hold and use a toothbrush. Some helpful
tips are:
■ Use an electric or battery-operated
toothbrush.
■ Slide a bicycle grip or foam tube over
the handle of the toothbrush.
■ Buy a toothbrush with a larger handle.
■ Attach the toothbrush handle to your
hand with a wide elastic band.
See your dentist if brushing or flossing
causes your gums to bleed or hurts your
mouth. If you have trouble flossing, a floss
holder may help. Ask your dentist to show
you the right way to floss.
Dentures
Sometimes, false teeth (dentures) are
needed to replace badly damaged teeth.
Partial dentures may be used to fill in one
or more missing teeth. Dentures may feel
strange at first. In the beginning, your
dentist may want to see you often to make
sure the dentures fit. Over time, your gums
will change shape, and your dentures may
need to be adjusted or replaced. Be sure to
let your dentist handle these adjustments.
Be careful when wearing dentures,
because it may be harder for you to feel
hot foods and drinks or notice bones in
your food. When learning to eat with
dentures, it may be easier if you:
■ Start with soft, non-sticky food.

■ Cut your food into small pieces.
■ Chew slowly using both sides of your
mouth.
Keep your dentures clean and free from
food that can cause stains, bad breath, or
swollen gums. Brush them every day with a
denture-care product. Take your dentures
out of your mouth at night, and soak them
in water or a denture-cleansing liquid.
Dry Mouth
Dry mouth happens when you don’t
have enough saliva, or spit, to keep your
mouth wet. It can make it hard to eat,
swallow, taste, and even speak. Dry mouth
can accelerate tooth decay and other
infections of the mouth. Many common
medicines can cause this problem.
There are things you can do that may
help. Try sipping water or sugarless drinks.
Don’t smoke, and avoid alcohol and caffeine.
Sugarless hard candy or sugarless gum that
is a little tart may help. Your dentist or
doctor might suggest using artificial saliva
to keep your mouth wet.
Oral Cancer.
Cancer of the mouth can grow in any
part of the mouth or throat. It is more
likely to happen in people over age 40. A
dental checkup is a good time for your
dentist to look for signs of oral cancer. Pain
is not usually an early symptom of the
disease. Treatment works best before the
disease spreads. Even if you have lost all
your natural teeth, you should still see
your dentist for regular oral cancer exams.
You can lower your risk of getting
oral cancer in a few ways:
■ Do not use tobacco products, such as
cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, chewing
tobacco, snuff, pipes, or cigars.
■ If you drink alcohol, do so only in
moderation.
■ Use lip balm with sunscreen.
Finding Low-Cost Dental Care
Dental care can be costly. Medicare
does not cover routine dental care, and
very few States offer dental coverage
under Medicaid. You may want to check
out private dental insurance for older
people. Make sure you are aware of the
cost and what services are covered. The
following resources may help you find
low-cost dental care:
■ Some dental schools have clinics
where students get experience treating
patients at a reduced cost. Qualified
dentists supervise the students. Visit
www.ada.org for a list of U.S. dental schools.
■ Dental hygiene schools may offer
supervised, low-cost care as part of the
training experience for dental hygienists.
See schools listed by State at www.adha.org.
■ Call your county or State health
department to find dental clinics near
you that charge based on your income.

■ To locate a community health center
near you that offers dental services, visit
www.findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov.
■ United Way chapters may be able to
direct you to free or reduced-cost dental
services in your community. Call “211” to
reach a local United Way chapter or visit
www.unitedway.org/find-your-united-way.
