Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease is an illness of the brain It breaks
down connections among brain cells and causes these
cells to die Over time, this affects how well a person
can remember, think clearly, and use good judgment
Alzheimer’s begins slowly and gets worse over time
Many people wonder if Alzheimer’s runs in the family Your
chance of having the disease may be higher if you have
certain genes passed down from a parent However, having
a parent with Alzheimer’s does not always mean that you
will develop it
This booklet will help you learn:
•	 what genes are
•	 how genes relate to Alzheimer’s disease
•	 what it means if you have a family history of
Alzheimer’s

Daniel’s story
My mom cares for her mother who has Alzheimer’s I like to
spend time with my grandmother and have seen how she
has changed over time We just learned that Aunt Adele, my
mom’s sister, also is showing signs of memory problems and
possible Alzheimer’s It makes me wonder if my mom will get
the disease, and if I’ll get it someday, too
I decided to ask my doctor about my chance of getting
Alzheimer’s He said he can’t tell for sure who will get the
disease but suggested some steps to stay healthy overall
Two steps I can take now are to eat right and exercise often

What are genes?

Genes are found in every cell in every person’s body (except
red blood cells) They are passed down from a person’s birth
parents They carry information that defines traits such as
eye color and height
Genes also play a role in keeping the body’s cells healthy
Problems with genes—even small changes to a gene—can
cause diseases like Alzheimer’s disease
Each human cell contains the instructions a cell needs to do its job
These instructions are made up of DNA, which is packed tightly into
structures called chromosomes Each chromosome has thousands of
segments called genes Parents pass down genes to their children

Do genes cause Alzheimer’s
disease?
Alzheimer’s is a complex disease Doctors and scientists
don’t know yet exactly what causes it But we do know that
a person’s genes can affect how likely they are to develop
the disease Having certain genes is a risk factor for
Alzheimer’s
A risk factor is something that increases the chance of
getting a disease For example, smoking is a risk factor for
cancer High blood pressure is a risk factor for stroke
Risk factors can include:
▪		 genes passed down from a parent to a child
▪		 a person’s health habits, like eating unhealthy food or
being inactive
▪		 something in a person’s surroundings, like in the air or
water
Genetic risk factors are changes or differences in genes that
can influence the chance of getting a disease These risk
factors are the reason some diseases run in families
There are two types of Alzheimer’s disease—late-onset and
early-onset They have different genetic risk factors
4 
Late-onset Alzheimer’s
Most people with Alzheimer’s first show signs of the disease
when they are in their mid-60s or later The risk for late-onset
Alzheimer’s increases as a person gets older
The causes of late-onset Alzheimer’s are not fully known
They likely involve a mix of genes, lifestyle, and environment
A gene called APOE (pronounced ay-po-ee) is often involved
in Alzheimer’s Genes can have multiple forms One form of
APOE, called APOE e4 (pronounced ay-po ee-for), increases
the risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s But, not everyone with
APOE e4 will develop Alzheimer’s Also, people without this
gene form can still develop the disease
The causes of late-onset Alzheimer’s likely involve genes, lifestyle,
and environment
5 
Early-onset Alzheimer’s
Early-onset Alzheimer’s is another type of the disease
People with this type start to show signs between age 30
and age 60 It is very rare
Most people with early-onset Alzheimer’s have familial
Alzheimer’s disease, or FAD Some types of FAD are
caused by a permanent change in one or more genes The
genetic change is passed down from a parent to a child
Some people with early-onset Alzheimer’s do not have FAD
The reason they get the disease is not known
Some differences between late-onset and
early-onset Alzheimer’s disease
Late-onset Alzheimer’s Early-onset Alzheimer’s
Signs first appear in the mid-60s Signs first appear between age
30 and age 60
Most common type Very rare
May involve a gene called
APOE e4
Usually caused by gene
changes passed down from
parent to child
6 
Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease
Many, but not all, people with Down syndrome develop
Alzheimer’s disease as they get older People with Down
syndrome are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21
This chromosome carries a gene that increases the risk of
Alzheimer’s This type of Alzheimer’s is not passed down
from a parent to a child

syndrome at wwwnianihgov/alzheimers/publication/

Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease as
they get older

Sharon’s story
I forgot to pay the rent for 2 months and recently lost my
glasses Sometimes, I can’t come up with the right word when
talking with others I could tell my husband was starting to
worry, and so was I
I decided it was time to see my doctor Some of my relatives
have had Alzheimer’s disease My father started having
memory problems when he was in his 60s I’m in my 60s now
The doctor asked me about my health and my family’s health
history He said that many things, like depression or a bad
reaction to medicine, can cause memory problems He
ordered some tests to help rule out Alzheimer’s disease
8 
If someone in my family has had
Alzheimer’s, will I have it, too?
Many people worry about developing Alzheimer’s disease,
especially if a family member has had it
Having a family history of the disease does not mean for
sure that you’ll have it, too But, it may mean you are more
likely to develop it
Late-onset Alzheimer’s
No one can yet predict if you will develop late-onset Alzheimer’s,
even if it runs in your family Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease has
been linked to APOE e4 But, having this gene form does not
always mean a person will develop the disease
Early-onset Alzheimer’s
Familial Alzheimer’s disease, or FAD—the most common
type of early-onset Alzheimer’s—is inherited If a parent
has a gene for FAD, there is a 50/50 chance that a child will
inherit the gene If the gene is passed down, the child will
usually—but not always—have FAD Doctors and scientists
don’t yet know if other types of early-onset Alzheimer’s can
be passed down
9 
How can I know if I’m at increased
risk for Alzheimer’s disease?
Families have many things in common, including their genes,
environment, and lifestyle Together, these things may offer
clues to diseases, like Alzheimer’s, that can run in a family
Late-onset Alzheimer’s
There is no test yet to predict if someone will get late-onset
Alzheimer’s If you are worried about changes in your
memory or other problems with your thinking, talk with your
doctor Let him or her know if one or more close relatives
has had the disease Your doctor can suggest ways to stay
healthy and watch for changes in your memory and thinking
Early-onset Alzheimer’s
There is a test to learn if you have the gene changes that
cause familial Alzheimer’s disease, or FAD
If you have a family history of FAD, talk with your doctor
about getting tested It’s your choice to get tested or not
Your doctor may suggest meeting first with a genetic
counselor This type of counselor helps people learn the risk
of getting genetic conditions They also help people make
decisions about testing and what comes next

Create a family health history
A family health history can help you and your doctor
know if Alzheimer’s disease runs in your family It lists
health facts about a person and close relatives It is a
written record of:
▪ a family’s health conditions
▪ lifestyle habits like smoking and exercise
▪ where and how family members grew up
Your family health history can show patterns of disease
and risk factors Try to include health facts about three
generations—grandparents, parents, and children

What can I do if I’m at increased
risk for Alzheimer’s disease?
No medicine or other treatment is currently known to
prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease But, you can take
steps to keep your brain and body as healthy as possible
These steps include:
* Exercise regularly
* Eat a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables
* Spend time with family and friends
* Keep your mind active
* Control type 2 diabetes
* Keep blood pressure and cholesterol at healthy levels
* Maintain a healthy weight
* Stop smoking
* Get help for depression
* Avoid drinking a lot of alcohol
* Get plenty of sleep
Talk with your doctor if you or someone close to you sees
changes in your memory or thinking

Learn about clinical trials and studies
Joining a clinical trial or other research study is a way to
help fight Alzheimer’s disease Some studies need people
with a family history of Alzheimer’s, and some seek families
with early-onset Alzheimer’s, or FAD Other studies need
healthy people with no history of the disease

Althea’s story
My dad and his brother found out in their 70s that they had
Alzheimer’s It seems to run in our family
My dad’s doctor suggested he join a clinical trial to test a new
medicine My dad agreed to join the trial He wants to help
find answers so others won’t have to suffer from this disease
in the future
I was inspired to volunteer for research, too I signed up for
the Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry, GeneMatch, and the
Brain Health Registry That way, I can be called on to take
part in future studies I want to do everything I can to help
fight this disease

What do I need to know?

▪		 Genes are passed down from a person’s birth parents
They carry information that determines a person’s traits
They also play a role in keeping a body’s cells healthy
▪		 Small changes or differences in a gene can lead to some
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
▪		 A family history of Alzheimer’s may mean a person is
more likely to develop the disease But, it does not mean
he or she will get Alzheimer’s for sure
▪		 People can take steps to keep their brains and bodies as
healthy as possible
▪		 Joining a clinical trial or signing up for a registry is a way
to help fight Alzheimer’s disease
Talk with your doctor if you or someone close to you has
changes in memory or thinking Your doctor can help find
out what might be causing the problems Many things that
cause memory or thinking problems can be treated
