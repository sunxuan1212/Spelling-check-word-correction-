Exercise and Physical Activity:
Getting Fit for Life
“My wife, Miki, and I have heart problems.
About 2 years ago, we joined our local health
club, where we do both endurance and
strength-training exercises. On the off days,
we walk near our house, stretch, and do a few
balance exercises. Being active helps us feel
better—and it’s good for our hearts!”
Bob and Miki know that exercise and
physical activity are good for you,
no matter how old you are. In fact,
staying active can help you:
■ Keep and improve your strength so
you can stay independent.
■ Have more energy to do the things
you want to do.
■ Improve your balance and prevent
falls.
■ Prevent or delay some diseases
like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes,
osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer.
■ Perk up your mood and reduce
feelings of depression.
■ Sleep better at night.
■ Reduce levels of stress and anxiety.
■ Reach or maintain a healthy weight.
You don’t need to buy special clothes
or belong to a gym to become more
active. Physical activity can and should
be part of your everyday life. Find things
you like to do. Go for brisk walks. Ride
a bike. Dance. Work around the house.
Garden. Climb stairs. Swim. Rake leaves.
Try different kinds of activities that keep
you moving. Look for new ways to build
physical activity into your daily routine.
Four Ways to Be Active
To get all of the benefits of physical
activity, try all four types of exercise:
(1) endurance, (2) strength, (3) balance,
and (4) flexibility.
1. Try to build up to at least 30 minutes
of activity that makes you breathe hard
on most or all days of the week. Every
day is best. That’s called an endurance
activity because it builds your energy or
“staying power.” You don’t have to be 
active for 30 minutes all at once. Try
to be active throughout your day to
reach this goal, and avoid sitting for
long periods of time.
How hard do you need to push
yourself? If you can talk without any
trouble at all, you are not working
hard enough. If you can’t talk at all,
it’s too hard.
2. Keep using your muscles. Strength
exercises build muscles. When you
have strong muscles, you can get up
from a chair by yourself, lift your
grandchildren, and walk through
the park.
Keeping your muscles strong can
help with your balance and prevent
falls and fall-related injuries. You are
less likely to fall when your leg and hip
muscles are strong.
3. Do things to help your balance. Try
standing on one foot, then the other.
If at first you need support, hold on to
something sturdy. Work your way up
to doing the exercises without support.
Get up from a chair without using
your hands or arms. Try the heel-totoe walk. As you walk, put the heel
of one foot just in front of the toes of
your other foot. Your heel and toes
should touch or almost touch.
4. Stretching can improve your
flexibility. Moving more freely will
make it easier for you to reach down
to tie your shoes or look over your
shoulder when you back your car out
of the driveway. Stretch when your
muscles are warmed up. Don’t stretch
so far that it hurts.
Who Should Exercise?
Almost anyone, at any age, can do
some type of physical activity. You can
still exercise even if you have a health
condition like heart disease, arthritis,
chronic pain, or diabetes. In fact, physical
activity may help. For most older adults,
brisk walking, riding a bike, swimming,
weight lifting, and gardening are safe,
especially if you build up slowly. If you
have any symptoms that haven’t been
diagnosed, or if you have a chronic
condition that is not being monitored by
a doctor, check with your doctor before
beginning an exercise routine. You can
always talk to your doctor if it makes you
more comfortable when starting to
be active.

Safety Tips.
Here are some things you can do to
make sure you are exercising safely:
■ Start slowly, especially if you haven’t
been active for a long time. Little by
little, build up your activities and how
hard you work at them.
■ Don’t hold your breath during strength
exercises. That could cause changes in
your blood pressure. It may seem strange
at first, but you should breathe out as you
lift something and breathe in as you relax.
■ Use safety equipment. For example,
wear a helmet for bike riding and the
right shoes for walking or jogging.
■ Unless your doctor has asked you to
limit fluids, be sure to drink plenty of
fluids when you are doing activities, even
if you don’t feel thirsty.
■ Always bend forward from the hips,
not the waist. If you keep your back
straight, you’re probably bending the
right way.
■ Warm up your muscles before you
stretch. Try walking and light arm
pumping first.
Exercise should not hurt or make
you feel really tired. You might feel
some soreness, a little discomfort, or a
bit weary, but you should not feel pain.
In fact, in many ways, being active will
probably make you feel better.

JCCs, or even area shopping malls for
exercise, wellness, or walking programs.
